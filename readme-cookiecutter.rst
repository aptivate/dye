Features
---------

Uses standard Aptivate stuff, including

- dye_ for deployment.

.. _dye: https://github.com/aptivate/dye

Constraints
-----------


Usage
------

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter git://github.com/aptivate/cookiecutter-django-dye.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a Django project for you.


**Warning**: After this point, change 'Hamish Downer', 'foobacca', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them::

    Cloning into 'cookiecutter-django'...
    remote: Counting objects: 49, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.
    remote: Total 49 (delta 6), reused 48 (delta 5)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (49/49), done.
    full_name (default is "Your full name here")? Hamish Downer
    email (default is "you@example.com")? hamish@aptivate.org
    project_name (default is "dj-project")? redditclone
    app_name (default is "djproject")? redditclone
    project_short_description (default is "Your project description goes here")? A reddit clone.
    release_date (default is "2013-08-15")? 2013-08-15
    year (default is "2013")? 2013
    version (default is "0.1.0")? 0.3.0

Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd redditclone/
    $ ls

Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit!"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:foobacca/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Awesome, right?

It's time to write the code!!!
    

"Your Stuff"
-------------

Scattered throughout the Python and HTML of this project are places marked with "your stuff". This is where third-party libraries are to be integrated with your project.
